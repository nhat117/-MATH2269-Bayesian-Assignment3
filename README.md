## Loan Default Risk Prediction Using Bayesian Logistic Regression

This project utilizes Bayesian logistic regression to analyze loan default risk using the HMEQ dataset, a widely used dataset in credit risk evaluation. The main objective is to identify significant predictors that affect loan default risk and assess model performance, stability, and accuracy across different preprocessing approaches.
